## Quota limits
##
!include_try quota.uri
# Quota limits are set using "quota_rule" parameters. To get per-user quota
# limits, you can set/override them by returning "quota_rule" extra field
# from userdb. It's also possible to give mailbox-specific limits, for example
# to give additional 100 MB when saving to Trash:

plugin {
  quota_rule = *:storage=20G
  quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+10%%
  quota_rule3 = Junk:storage=+20%%

  # LDA/LMTP allows saving the last mail to bring user from under quota to
  # over quota, if the quota doesn't grow too high. Default is to allow as
  # long as quota will stay under 10% above the limit. Also allowed e.g. 10M.
  #quota_grace = 10%%

  # Quota plugin can also limit the maximum accepted mail size.
  #quota_max_mail_size = 100M
}

# Example quota-warning service. The unix listener's permissions should be
# set in a way that mail processes can connect to it. Below example assumes
# that mail processes run as vmail user. If you use mode=0666, all system users
# can generate quota warnings to anyone.
#service quota-warning {
#  executable = script /usr/local/bin/quota-warning.sh
#  user = dovecot
#  unix_listener quota-warning {
#    user = vmail
#  }
#}

##
## Quota backends
##


# Multiple quota roots are also possible, for example this gives each user
# their own 100MB quota and one shared 1GB quota within the domain:
#plugin {
  #quota = dict:user::proxy::quota
  #quota2 = dict:domain:%d:proxy::quota_domain
  #quota_rule = *:storage=102400
  #quota2_rule = *:storage=1048576
#}
